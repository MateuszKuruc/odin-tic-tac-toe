# odin-tic-tac-toe


<p>Classic tic tac toe game for two local players.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a project that is a next step in learning JavaScript. The goal was to handle logic of the game so two players can make their moves in turns.</p>
<p>Building the game required me to get stronger understanding of conditional statements in order to calculate possible plays, keeping score and determining the winner.</p>
